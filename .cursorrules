# Project Rules for Google Maps Scraper

## Testing & Running
- Do NOT automatically run `npx apify-cli run` or any test commands after making code changes
- Only run the scraper when the user explicitly asks to test or run it
- Let the user decide when to test the changes themselves

## Code Style
- This is an Apify Actor project using Crawlee and Puppeteer
- Use ES modules (import/export syntax)
- Do not export modules from utility files unless they need to be imported elsewhere
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in the project

## Apify-Specific
- Input is read via `Actor.getInput()`
- Output is saved via `Dataset.pushData()`
- Use `Actor.createProxyConfiguration()` for proxies
- The actor runs headless by default
